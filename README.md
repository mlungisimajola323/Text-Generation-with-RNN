# Text-Generation-with-RNN
Software application that learns from a body of text

Build a software application that learns from a body of text (e.g., Shakespeareâ€™s plays or song lyrics) and can generate new, coherent text in a similar style using a Recurrent Neural Network.

## Method
### Choose dataset to train on.
### Install libraries
### Tokenize the text into characters or words
### Create sequences (input-output pairs)

## Build the RNN Model 
### Create a simple RNN/LSTM/GRU
### Define Loss function and optimizer
### Add functionality for training and saving models

## Training
### Feed the sequences into the model
### Track the training loss and accuracy
### Training log (loss over time)

## Generate Text
### Load the trained model
### Create a function to generate text based on a prompt
### Add temperature sampling to control creativity
