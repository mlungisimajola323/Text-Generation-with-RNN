# Text-Generation-with-RNN
Software application that learns from a body of text

Build a software application that learns from a body of text (e.g., Shakespeareâ€™s plays or song lyrics) and can generate new, coherent text in a similar style using a Recurrent Neural Network.

## Method
### Choose dataset to train on.
### Install libraries
### Tokenize the text into characters or words
### Create sequences (input-output pairs)

## Build the RNN Model 
### Create a simple LSTM/GRU RNN
###
